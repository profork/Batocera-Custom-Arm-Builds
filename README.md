# Batocera-Custom-Arm-Builds
Custom Batocera builds with extra features enabled

You can either flash a new image to MicrosSD card as usual or copy boot.tar.xz to `/userdata/system/upgrade` and then run `batocera-upgrade manual` from ssh/terminal

ðŸš€Recents:
* Added RPI3 v42 butterfly with F1 menu, Flatpak and xwayland enabled. (v42 builds have flaky HDMI audio..need to toggle to different device and back to reset)
    * -Should help increase compatibility for some portmaster games and flatpak apps.  Don't expect youtube beyond 480p though. Still slow performance.
   

  
* Added: ODIN2 and ODIN2 Portal builds with Flatpak and RPCS3 enabled (v42 butterfly)






*Cemu does not work on Batocera for Odin2.  Use Rocknix for built in Aethersx2,  Cemu and the Rocknix Uzucore build if you want that other emulator too


## Aethersx2, Portmaster and other addons available in https://github.com/profork/profork ##
