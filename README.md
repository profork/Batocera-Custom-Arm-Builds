# Batocera-Custom-Arm-Builds
Custom Batocera builds with extra features enabled

You can either flash a new image to MicrosSD card as usual or copy boot.tar.xz to `/userdata/system/upgrade` and then run `batocera-upgrade manual` from ssh/terminal

ðŸš€Recents:
* Added: ODIN2 and ODIN2 Portal builds with Flatpak and RPCS3 enabled (v42 butterfly)

Aethersx2 and other addons available in https://github.com/profork/profork
CEMU does not work on Batocers for Odin2.  Use Rocknix for cemu and the Rocknix Uzucore build if you want that other emulator too
